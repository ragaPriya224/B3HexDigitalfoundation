PYTHON 

WHAT IS PYTHON?
--------------

Python is a interpreted, interactive, general purpose , object-oriented high level programming language.

interpreted -> which means line-by-line execution of code.  

Interactive -> which means, it returns the result of the statement if correct else it returns the error message that helps in debugging 

general purpose -> which means it can be used to build just about anything. 

object-oriented -> which means, it support object-oriented programming feature 
( it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isnâ€™t specialized for any specific problem )

high level programming language.-> which means, it reads like English and is more easy to understand. 

HISTORY OF PYTHON:
-----------------

Designed by Guido van Rossum,
used to build softwares, websites etc. 
Latest version -> Python 3.10. 2

BEST IDES FOR PYTHON:
---------------------

PySpark,VS code, jupyter, anaconda, etc
Many PC's, Macs  will have python already installed. to check        Python --version 
IF not, download from here     https://www.python.org/


What python can do?
-------------------
-> used on server to create web apps
-> connect to db's. Can modify/read files
-> handle big data and perform complex maths

WHY PYTHON?
-----------
-> work on diff platforms
-> simple syntax similiar to english
-> few lines 

where python used
------------------
-> desktop
-> game development
-> AI
-> DL
-> ML
-> IOT
-> Data analysis 
-> Web development
->Automation
->Software testing 
 -> Everyday tasks
 
 Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
-----------------------------------------
Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.


java -> .java
javascript -> .js
python -> .py 


What is the difference between statically typed and dynamically typed languages?

Statically typed languages
----------------------------
A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is;
EG: JAVA, etc

Dynamically Typed Language
--------------------------

A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc.
Eg: python, js
